# Face-Recognition-App
This project was created referring to the paper "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" which is present in the files above
## Why Siamese Network?
Neural networks are good at almost every task but they rely on more and more data to perform well. For certain problems like facial recognition and signature verification, we can‚Äôt always rely on getting more data. To solve these kinds of tasks we have a new type of neural network architecture called siamese networks.

## What is a Siamese Network?
A siamese neural network (SNN) is a class of neural network architectures that contain two or more identical sub-networks. ‚ÄúIdentical‚Äù here means they have the same configuration with the same parameters and weights. Parameter updating is mirrored across both sub-networks and it‚Äôs used to find similarities between inputs by comparing feature vectors.
## What are the advantages of using it?

- üëâ  are capable of learning generic image features useful for making predictions about unknown class distributions even when very few examples from these new distributions are available;
- üëâ  are easily trained using standard optimization techniques on pairs sampled from the source
data; 
- üëâ provide a competitive approach that does not rely upon domain-specific knowledge by instead exploiting deep learning techniques.

## STEPS
- Data Colection
- Preparing Data
- Building the Network
- Training the Network
- Making Kivy app using OpenCV and Tensorflow
-
